I am a Senior Research Scholar with North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies (NCICS) specializing in artificial intelligence and long-term satellite data records. Since joining NCICS in 2019, my research has focused on improving long-term satellite environmental data records using innovative statistical models, including machine learning. My broad research interests focus on advanced statistical models, satellite data development/validation, land–atmosphere interaction, and applied research for climate and environment monitoring.

Through Cooperative Institute for Satellite Earth System Studies, I am a founding member of NOAA Center for Artificial Intelligence (NCAI). In support of NCAI, I co-lead the development of data standards and guidelines on AI-ready data for Earth and space science data and workforce development efforts for NOAA. Additionally, I co-chair the annual NOAA AI Workshop that convenes NOAA researchers and partners to advance collaboration around AI research and development in environmental sciences.

I am actively engaged in national and international communities in Earth system science, including Earth Science Information Partners, the American Geophysical Union, and World Climate Research Programme. I currently co-chair the Working Group on Observations for Researching Climate, a working group within the World Climate Research Programme’s Earth System Modeling and Observations core project.

Additionally, I am passionate about open science, community resilience, and community engagement. My interest in community engagement through scientific communication and outreach activities was developed during my time at the University of Maryland as a graduate student. I am constantly working to improve my skills for community engagement and collaborate with partners including scientists from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information on climate and environmental conservation-related topics.
