I am a research scientist with the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies at North Carolina State University. 
My research focuses on leveraging data science and diverse environmental data to monitor global and regional surface 
temperature changes and their impact on ecosystems and society. My most recent research uses statistical 
methods to fill the temperature data gaps caused by the uneven distribution of historical observation networks. 
While excited about the potential of data science for addressing social issues, I am increasingly interested in 
understanding how to ensure data science is used in environmental research ethically and responsibly.

Beyond research, I am also actively engaged in national and international communities, including Earth Science Information 
Partners (ESIP), the American Geophysical Union (AGU), and the Young Earth System Scientists community (YESS). I currently 
serve as a steering committee member for the Future Earth Project â€“ Analysis, Integration, and Modeling of the Earth System.

Additionally, I am passionate about open science, environmental justice, and community engagement. My interest in community 
engagement through scientific communication and outreach activities was developed during my time at the University of Maryland. 
I am constantly working to improve my skills for community engagement and collaborate with partners including scientists from 
NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information on climate and environmental conservation-related topics.
